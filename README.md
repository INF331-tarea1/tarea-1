## Description

This password manager is a software application designed to help users securely and conveniently manage and protect their passwords. This application allows users to store, generate, and retrieve passwords securely, all under the control of a master password. This project was built as an assignment for the Software Testing course at Universidad TÃ©cnica Federico Santa Maria.

## Installation

This software supports Windows and Linux

There are two options:

- Download the latest release for console execution; no additional packages need to be downloaded.
- Download the source code; in this case, it is necessary to run the main.py file with Python 3.10+ and also download the following packages with pip:
  - cryptography
  - pyperclip
  - prettyyable
  - secrets
  - getpass
  - base64
  - sqlite3

## How to Use

Once the password manager is installed, when you run it, it will prompt you for a master password. This master password will be required every time the program is executed. After entering the master password, a menu with various options will be displayed on the screen. Write the number of the desired option to access it and follow the instructions provided by the software.
